## New stuff! (*Initial commit 2*)

- **Fish**: There is now a fish config that comes with the dotfiles
- **Removal of the install script**: I honestly hated that file >:(
- **Layer-Shell blur**: Yes, you heard me, "Layer-Shell blur", It has been added to the default hyprland config file, I also renamed the file right (Bad spelling)
- **Ditching hyprpanel**: It's bloated, **Stick to waybar!**
